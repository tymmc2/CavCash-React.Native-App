React-Native app for the former CavCash Payment Processor designed by me.

## What is this code supposed to be?
Well, this code was intended for use with the CavCash Payment Processing system with a focus on cross-platform support between both Android and iOS using React.Native. Since CavCash no longer exists as a payment processing platform, I have decided to publish my work on the front-end for my portfolio.

For this app, I have designed several components for custom UI design in order to get the look out of the app that I wanted. This is the result of several iterations over several years of rewriting and redesigning the app as my skills improved.

## History of the app
Initially, this app started out as a Swift mobile application, which was my introduction to mobile application development and, as a result, was not very good. The app was extremely basic without any actual connections to a back-end or anything and was mostly just UI. Even the sign-in didn't really do anything besides take you to another page.

Then came along Xamarin.Forms. Most of the iterations between the Swift version and this version were done with Xamarin.Forms as there really wasn't a reason for me to switch to anything else. Moreover, I did not have any knowledge with React at all for most of the time so using C#, which I had experience with, was the better option.

For several years, I continued to improve the app's design, flow, and features iteratively attempting to both improve my skills and the app for users. Then in 2020 during the pandemic I decided to learn React, which I happened to really enjoy the amount of freedom it gives you over pure JS applications and Xamarin.Forms. Initially, I decided to move the website over to React, as that client desperately needed a modern upgrade due to being a financial service.

Later on, after several iterations of the website, I decided to switch over from Xamarin.Forms to React.Native in an attempt to produce a more central codebase between the website and the app. For the most part, this was true; however, most code that was able to be ported over needed a rewrite to handle React.Native due to TypeScript and React.Native view designs. As a result, this app was produced with most features from the Xamarin.Forms app and a few extras.

Thus, this version is the latest and final version of the CavCash mobile app and will most likely never be updated in the future. If anyone is interested in using my code, feel free to use it within the bounds of the GPL license that this project utilizes.

## Important note
This code will most likely compile and run on your device; however, it will require some tinkering with in most areas in order for the application to be functional as the server is no longer running these endpoints. Moreover, there will be missing assets as I do not own those and they are not necessary for the application. This includes fonts, so fonts throughout the application may vary on your device depending on what you have.

If you have any questions or issues, feel free to make use of the GitHub features for repos.
